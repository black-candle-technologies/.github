# Black Candle Technologies

We're a small team of people working to create something amazing. We decided to start relatively small with a Minecraft Server, but we still have very big ambitions. Our Network will span 8 planets, allowing for cross-planetary travel through a Space Station and a Planetary Spaceport system. We'll have custom generated terrain, and custom items, resources and armor. Our amazing team is working on custom textures and models for our server as well. We expect Starfall to launch in Q2 2023.

While we work on our server, Black Candle is also working on a small 2D Platformer which will allow us to get a little bit of game development under our belt. This game is expected to release in Q1 2023, as we are competing in the CCLL (Creative Careers Leadership Lab) Animation, Visual Effects and Game Production challenge, which will be due in February.
